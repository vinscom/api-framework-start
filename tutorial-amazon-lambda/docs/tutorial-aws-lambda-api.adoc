= Amazon Lambda API

.Serverless Architectures
[quote, Mike Roberts, https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html]
Serverless architectures refer to applications that significantly depend on third-party
services (knows as Backend as a Service or "BaaS") or on custom code that's run in
ephemeral containers (Function as a Service or "FaaS"), the best known vendor host of
which currently is AWS Lambda.

API Framework allows you to effortlessly run your API code as Lambda function in
AWS ecosystem. In this tutorial, we will setup, Amazon API Gateway to access Session
GET API (created as part of previous tutorial) and Amazon Lambda to execute Session
GET logic.

== Lambda Project Setup

We will be extending
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/create-deployment-pkg-zip-java.html[Amazon Lambda Example Project]
to run *Session GET API*. Example Lambda project is setup in Gradle. So, instead of
Maven, we will be using Gradle Project for this tutorial.

== Gradle Project Files

=== settings.gradle
[source,groovy,linenums]
----
include::./../settings.gradle[]
----
This file only contain project name.

=== build.gradle
[source,groovy,linenums]
----
include::./../build.gradle[]
----
*api-framework-amazon-lambda* is the required dependency. As we have already done
all the work to write session api as part of *Simple GET API* tutorial. Instead of writing
any new code, we have included *Simple GET API* project as dependency in our project.

=== gradle.properties
[source,ini,linenums]
----
include::./../gradle.properties[]
----

Currently, Amazon Lambda only supports Java 1.8. In case you are having problem
compiling project (Because you have installed Java 1.9). You can specifically JDK here.

=== Create Build

.Run
[source,sh,linenums]
----
gradle buildZip
----

Your Lambda deployment package will get created at
`build/distributions/tutorial-amazon-lambda.zip`

== Setup Lambda Function

. Go to AWS Management Console
. Goto Lambda
+
image::amazon-lambda/aws-lambda-home.png[]
Create lambda function using *Create Function*
. Create Function Screen
+
image::amazon-lambda/aws-lambda-author-from-scratch.png[]
  - *Name* : handleProcess
  - *Runtime* : Java 8
  - *Role* :  Create role from template.
    * *Role Name* : BasicPermission
    * *Policy templates* : Basic Edge Lambda permissions
. Function Code
+
image::amazon-lambda/aws-lambda-config.png[]
  - *Function Package* : Upload _tutorial-amazon-lambda.zip_ file ( Amazon recommends
    S3 for uploading larger then 10MB file. For simplicity, just upload file directly from here.)
  - *Handle* : Enter _in.erail.amazon.lambda.AWSLambda_ (Only class package
  and class name. No handle)
  - *Environment Variable*
    * *JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS*  :  _-Dservice=/in/erail/tutorial/SessionGetService -Dglue.layers=./lib/api-framework-1.0-SNAPSHOT-common-config.zip,./lib/tutorial-simple-get-api-1.0-SNAPSHOT-common-config.zip,./lib/api-framework-amazon-lambda-1.0-SNAPSHOT-common-config.zip -Dvertx.cacheDirBase=/tmp/vertx-cache -Dvertx.logger-delegate-factory-class-name=io.vertx.core.logging.Log4j2LogDelegateFactory -Dlog4j.configurationFile=./log4j2.xml_

. Basic Settings
+
image::amazon-lambda/aws-lambda-basic-settings.png[]
Ensure you set memory to 256MB minimum. Or else you will get memory out of exception
. Create Test Event
+
image::amazon-lambda/aws-lambda-test.png[]
  - *Event Template* : API Gateway AWS Proxy
  - *Event Name* : SessionGETAPITestEvent
  - *Event Body* : Though body is POST message. Keep it as it is. Lambda function gets
  everything as JSON Object. Mapping between correct URL and Method type and
  Lambda function is managed at API Gateway level. Here we just want to test our
  Lambda function.
. Test Result

image::amazon-lambda/aws-lambda-test-result.png[]

== Setup API Gateway

Now our Lambda function is setup. Lets use Amazon API Gateway to expose our API.

. Create API
+
image::amazon-api-gateway/amazon-api-gateway-home.png[]

  - *API name* : _Tutorial Session Get API_
+
NOTE:  API Gateway supports Swagger 2.0. API Framework supports Open API 3
specifications. As Open API 3 specification is becoming industry standard.
Expectation is that Amazon will start supporting Open API 3 in future. Till then,
you will have to create API manually.

. Create Resource
+
image::amazon-api-gateway/amazon-api-gateway-create-resource.png[]
Our API will be accessible on _/session_ URL.

. Configure Resource
+
image::amazon-api-gateway/amazon-api-gateway-resource-config.png[]
  - *Resource Name* : _session_
  - *Resource Path* : URL _/session_

. Create Action
+
image::amazon-api-gateway/amazon-api-gateway-get-action.png[]
  - *GET Action* : Create GET action. Configure action as per image.

. Save Action
+
image::amazon-api-gateway/amazon-api-gateway-get-action-save.png[]

. Method Setup
+
image::amazon-api-gateway/amazon-api-gateway-get-action-created.png[]
Final API setup

. Test API
+
image::amazon-api-gateway/amazon-api-gateway-get-action-test.png[]

Our API is working!!!

== Deploy API

Now, lets make our API public. To make our API public, we will have to create stage.
Stage will give us unique URL through which we can access our API (If you want, you can
also map this stage to your custom domain) .

NOTE: As this is tutorial, we are not using any type of authentication. Please
make sure you have right level of access in any stage API.

. Deploy API
+
image::amazon-api-gateway/amazon-api-gateway-deploy-api.png[]

. Create new stage
+
image::amazon-api-gateway/amazon-api-gateway-deploy-api-config.png[]
  - *Deployment Stage* : _New Stage_
  - *Stage Name* : _tutorial_

. Stage Home
+
image::amazon-api-gateway/amazon-api-gateway-stage-home.png[]

Using *Invoka URL* we can access our API. To access API use below URL.

Done!!!
