== Step 1:Create Open API 3 Service Definition

To make life easy, we have used https://studio.apicur.io[Apicurio] to create Open API 3
definition. Below is definition

.openapi3.json
[source,json,linenums]
----
include::./../config-layers/common/in/erail/route/openapi3.json[]
----

Our API will have single URL /session (like http://localhost:8080/session). Session is not
related to actual Vertx session.

.GET
On get request, session API will return all session messages.

NOTE: Each method requiring processing must have *unique OperationId*. OperationId
is used for processing request from method.

=== Configure API Framework to use service definition

Copy openapi3.json to *config-layers/common/in/erail/route/openapi3.json*. Now
API Framework is configured to handle API Request. Next step is to write code to handle
request.
